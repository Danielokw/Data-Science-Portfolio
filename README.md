## Summer Research Internship
During the summer of 2023, I had the opportunity to work as a Research intern at Xavier University in Cincinnati, OH. In this role, I was actively involved in gathering, organizing, and translating data to enhance overall understanding. My responsibilities included delving into complex datasets, extracting meaningful insights, and presenting them through graphical representations. Through this experience, I not only honed my data manipulation skills but also developed a keen eye for visual communication of data insights. Worked collaboratively within a team to achieve research objectives and contribute to the success of the projects, and also engaged in regular team discussions, brainstorming sessions, and knowledge-sharing activities.

## Reggie Harris Campaign Experience
As a dedicated volunteer for the Reggie Harris Campaign in Cincinnati, OH, I played a crucial role in supporting campaign initiatives and leveraging data science techniques to enhance decision-making processes.

Campaign Outcome Prediction
I spearheaded efforts to predict campaign outcomes by analyzing and interpreting previous election results. Through a comprehensive analysis of historical data, I contributed valuable insights to the campaign strategy, aiding in informed decision-making.

Data Visualization Strategies
Utilizing my data science skills, I developed and implemented data visualization strategies to effectively communicate campaign insights. I created insightful histograms specifically focused on Base and Swing data, providing a visual representation of key trends and patterns.

Dynamic Mapping
I designed and crafted dynamic maps that illustrated Base, Swing, and Residual regions. These maps served as powerful tools to understand the political landscape, enabling the campaign team to identify strongholds, potential swing areas, and regions requiring additional attention
